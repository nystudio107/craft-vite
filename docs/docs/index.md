## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0 or later, or Craft CMS 4.0.0 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require nystudio107/craft-vite

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Vite.

## Vite Overview

Vite is a bridge between Craft CMS/Twig and the next generation frontend build tool [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)

Vite allows for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) of JavaScript, CSS, and Twig (even through errors) during development, as
well as optimized production builds.

Vite supports both modern and legacy bundle builds, as per
the [Deploying ES2015+ Code in Production Today](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/)
article.

Vite also handles generating the necessary `<script>` and `<link>` tags to support both synchronous and asynchronous
loading of JavaScript and CSS.

Additionally, Vite has a caching layer to ensure optimal performance.

## Configuring Vite

Vite.js is JavaScript frontend tooling, so by default it uses an `index.html` as
an [entrypoint to your application](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root), but with the Vite plugin and
some minor configuration changes, we can use it with server-rendered setups like [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com).

Configuration for Vite is done via the `config.php` config file. Here’s the default `config.php`; it should be renamed
to `vite.php` and copied to your `config/` directory to take effect.

### The `config.php` File

```php
<?php

use craft\helpers\App;

return [
    'useDevServer' => App::env('ENVIRONMENT') === 'dev' || App::env('CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT') === 'dev',
    'manifestPath' => '@webroot/dist/manifest.json',
    'devServerPublic' => 'http://localhost:3000/',
    'serverPublic' => App::env('PRIMARY_SITE_URL') . '/dist/',
    'errorEntry' => '',
    'cacheKeySuffix' => '',
    'devServerInternal' => '',
    'checkDevServer' => false,
    'includeReactRefreshShim' => false,
    'includeModulePreloadShim' => true,
    'criticalPath' => '@webroot/dist/criticalcss',
    'criticalSuffix' =>'_critical.min.css',
];
```

These are the settings you’ll need to change for your project:

* **`useDevServer`** - is a `boolean` that sets whether you will be
  using [Vite dev server](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) for hot module replacement (
  HMR). If this is set to `false`, the files will be pulled from the `manifest.json` specified in `manifestPath`
* **`manifestPath`** - the public server path to your manifest files; it can be a full URL or a partial path, or a Yii2
  alias. This is usually the same as whatever you set your `build.outDir` to in `vite.config.js`
* **`devServerPublic`** - the URL to the Vite dev server, which is used for the hot module replacement (HMR); it can be
  a full URL or a partial path, or a Yii2 alias. Usually this is `http://localhost:3000`, since Vite defaults to that.
  This will appear in `<script>` tags on the frontend when the dev server is running
* **`serverPublic`** - the public server URL to your asset files; it can be a full URL or a partial path, or a Yii2
  alias. This will appear in `<script>` tags on the frontend for production
  builds. `App::env('PRIMARY_SITE_URL') . '/dist/'` is a typical setting

These are completely optional settings that you probably won’t need to change:

* **`errorEntry`** - is a string, or array of strings, that should be the JavaScript entry point(s) (for
  example: `src/js/app.ts`) in your `manifest.json` that should be injected into Twig error templates, to allow hot
  module replacement to work through Twig error pages. `devMode` must be `true` and **useDevServer** must also be `true`
  for this to have any effect.
* **`cacheKeySuffix`** - String to be appended to the cache key
* **`devServerInternal`** - The internal URL to the dev server, when accessed from the environment in which PHP is
  executing. This can be the same as `$devServerPublic`, but may be different in containerized or VM setups. ONLY used
  if `$checkDevServer = true`
* **`checkDevServer`** - Should we check for the presence of the dev server by pinging $devServerInternal to make sure
  it’s running?
* **`includeReactRefreshShim`** - whether or not the
  required [shim for `react-refresh`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/backend-integration.html#backend-integration) should be
  included when the Vite dev server is running
* **`includeModulePreloadShim`** - whether or not
  the [shim for `modulepreload-polyfill`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#preload-directives-generation) should
  be included to polyfill `<link rel="modulepreload">`

If you’re using the [rollup-plugin-critical](https://github.com/nystudio107/rollup-plugin-critical) to
generate [critical CSS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/implementing-critical-css), use these settings:

* **`criticalPath`** - File system path (or URL) to where the Critical CSS files are stored
* **`criticalSuffix`** - the suffix added to the name of the currently rendering template for the critical CSS filename

Note also that the **manifestPath** defaults to a Yii2 alias `@webroot/dist/manifest.json` (adjust as necessary to point
to your `manifest.json` on the file system); this allows Vite to load the manifest from the file system, rather than via
http request, and is the preferred method. However, it works fine as a full URL as well if you have your `manifest.json`
hosted on a CDN or such.

### Configuring Vite.js

#### Basic Config

Here’s a basic `vite.config.js` for use as a [Vite config](https://vitejs.dev/config/):

```js
export default ({command}) => ({
  base: command === 'serve' ? '' : '/dist/',
  build: {
    manifest: true,
    outDir: '../cms/web/dist/',
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        app: './src/js/app.ts',
      }
    },
  },
});
```

* **`base`** - set to the root if the dev server is running, and otherwise set it to `/dist/` so our built assets are in
  their own directory (and often not checked into Git).
* **`build.manifest`** - set to `true` so that the [Rollup build](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) will generate a
  manifest file of the production assets
* **`build.outDir`** - specifies where the built production assets should go, as a file system path relative to
  the `vite.config.js` file.
* **`build.rollupOptions.input`** - set to an object that
  has [key-value pairs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#multi-page-app) for each of our entrypoint scripts (needed
  since we’re not using an `index.html` as our application entrypoint). These should be the full path to the script as
  referenced in your Twig code

#### Specifying the dev server port

Prior to version 3, Vite used port `3000` by default for the dev server. Now it uses port `5173` by default, so we can specify the port we want to use specifically:

```js
export default ({command}) => ({
  base: command === 'serve' ? '' : '/dist/',
  build: {
    manifest: true,
    outDir: '../cms/web/dist/',
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        app: './src/js/app.ts',
      }
    },
  },
  server: {
    fs: {
      strict: false
    },
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
    port: 3000,
    strictPort: true,
  }
});
```


#### Modern + Legacy Config

By default, Vite generates JavaScript bundles that work with modern browsers that
support [native ESM](https://caniuse.com/es6-module).

If you require support for legacy browsers, you can use
the [@vitejs/plugin-legacy](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy) plugin:

```js
import legacy from '@vitejs/plugin-legacy'

export default ({command}) => ({
  base: command === 'serve' ? '' : '/dist/',
  build: {
    manifest: true,
    outDir: '../cms/web/dist/',
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        app: './src/js/app.ts',
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    legacy({
      targets: ['defaults', 'not IE 11']
    }),
  ],
});
```

This will generate `-legacy` files for your production bundles, and the Vite plugin automatically detects them and uses
the [module/nomodule](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) pattern for you.

#### Entry Script HMR

Your entry scripts are what you list in the `build.rollupOptions.input` section of the config.

Vite is typically used with frameworks which take care of the HMR via the dev server. However,  in order to get your entry scripts to HMR you need to add this snippet to each entry script:

```js
// Accept HMR as per: https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-hmr.html
if (import.meta.hot) {
  import.meta.hot.accept(() => {
    console.log("HMR")
  });
}
```

If you don't do the above, you'll get a full page reload whenever you modify one of your entry scripts.

Anything your scripts import will be automatically HMR'd by the dev server.

#### Live Reload of Twig Config

Vite provides hot module replacement (HRM) of CSS and JavaScript as you build your application out of the box.

If you want live reload of your Twig (or other) files as you develop, you can get that with
the [vite-plugin-restart](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-restart) plugin:

```js
import ViteRestart from 'vite-plugin-restart';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default ({command}) => ({
  base: command === 'serve' ? '' : '/dist/',
  build: {
    manifest: true,
    outDir: '../cms/web/dist/',
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        app: './src/js/app.ts',
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    ViteRestart({
      reload: [
        '../cms/templates/**/*',
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

* **`plugins.ViteRestart.reload`** - lets you specify and array of file system paths or globs to watch for changes, and
  issue a page refresh if any of the files change

The Vite plugin has support for enabling live refresh even through Twig error pages as you develop.

### Local Development Environment Setup

#### Using HTTPS

If you’re using TLS (https) in local dev, you may get mixed content errors if you don’t change your `devServerPublic`
to `https` (and you’d need change your [server.HTTPS](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-https) Vite config too).

Then you’ll want to ensure you have a trusted self-signed certificate for your browser, or you can use
the [vite-plugin-mkcert](https://github.com/liuweiGL/vite-plugin-mkcert) plugin.

#### Using Laravel Valet

If you’re using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet) you
may [run into issues](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/4) with `https`. If so, you can add this config
to your `vite.config.js` (see below):

```js
server: {
  https: {
    key: fs.readFileSync('localhost-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('localhost.pem'),
  },
  hmr: {
    host: 'localhost',
  }
}
```

#### Using Homestead/VM

If you’re using a VM like Homestead, to get Hot Module
Replacement [(HMR) working](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/3), you’ll need to add this config to
your `vite.config.js` (see below):

```js
server: {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
    watch: {
    usePolling: true,
  },
}
```

To work inside of a VM like VirtualBox (which is typically used by Homestead) you need to enable polling.

#### Using Docker

To work properly with a Docker setup, the `server.host` needs to be set to `0.0.0.0` so that it broadcasts to all
available IPv4 addresses in your `vite.config.js` (see below):

```js
server: {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
}
```

#### Using DDEV

To run Vite inside a DDEV container, you’ll have
to [define a custom service](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/custom-compose-files/) that proxies
requests from the frontend to the vite server running inside the VM. This is done by creating
a `/.ddev/docker-compose.*.yaml` file, and exposing an additional port to your project.

Create a file named `docker-compose.vite.yaml` and save it in your project’s `/.ddev` folder, with the following
contents:

```yaml
# Override the web container's standard HTTP_EXPOSE and HTTPS_EXPOSE services
# to expose port `3000` of DDEV's web container.
version: '3.6'
services:
  web:
    expose:
      - '3000'
    environment:
      - HTTP_EXPOSE=${DDEV_ROUTER_HTTP_PORT}:80,${DDEV_MAILHOG_PORT}:8025,3001:3000
      - HTTPS_EXPOSE=${DDEV_ROUTER_HTTPS_PORT}:80,${DDEV_MAILHOG_HTTPS_PORT}:8025,3000:3000
```

In your `vite.config.js`, the `server.host` should to be set to `0.0.0.0`, and `server.port` set to `3000`:

```
server: {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000
}
```

With the above set up, Craft Vite will now have access to the `devServerInternal` via `http://localhost:3000`,
and `devServerPublic` via `https://projectname.ddev.site:3000`. Note that `devServerPublic` can run over http or
https, `devServerInternal` is always http. Your `config/vite.php` file might thus look like:

```php
<?php

use craft\helpers\App;

return [
    'checkDevServer' => true,
    'devServerInternal' => 'http://localhost:3000',
    'devServerPublic' => App::env('PRIMARY_SITE_URL') . ':3000',
    'serverPublic' => App::env('PRIMARY_SITE_URL') . '/dist/',
    'useDevServer' => App::env('ENVIRONMENT') === 'dev' || App::env('CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT') === 'dev',
    // other config settings...
];
```

If you’re using the [rollup-plugin-critical](https://github.com/nystudio107/rollup-plugin-critical) to
generate [critical CSS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/implementing-critical-css), you must add extra Debian packages to
enable Puppeteer Headless Chrome support. Add the following line to your `/.ddev/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
webimage_extra_packages: [ gconf-service, libasound2, libatk1.0-0, libcairo2, libgconf-2-4, libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0, libgtk-3-0, libnspr4, libpango-1.0-0, libpangocairo-1.0-0, libx11-xcb1, libxcomposite1, libxcursor1, libxdamage1, libxfixes3, libxi6, libxrandr2, libxrender1, libxss1, libxtst6, fonts-liberation, libappindicator1, libnss3, xdg-utils ]
```

Then be sure to set `criticalUrl` to `http://localhost` as part of your rollup configuration.

Finally note that as of DDEV 1.19 you are able to specify Node (and Composer) versions directly via `/.ddev/config.yaml`.  See more at https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#nodejs-npm-nvm-and-yarn


### Vite-Processed Assets

This is cribbed from the [Laravel Vite integration](https://laravel-vite.netlify.app/guide/usage.html#static-assets)
docs:

There is currently
an [unsolved issue when referencing assets in files processed by Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/2196), such
as a Vue or CSS file. In development, URLs will not be properly rewritten.

Additionally, there is currently no way to get the path of a Vite-processed asset (for example an image that was
imported in a Vue SFC) from the back-end, since the manifest does not reference the original file path. In most cases,
this should not be an issue, as this is not a common use case.

What you can do is leverage the /public [Public Directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory)
for static assets in Vite, so the URLs will not get rewritten.

The basic problem is if you have a CSS rule like:

```css
background-image: url('/src/img/woof.jpg');
```

...and your local dev runs off of something like `myhost.test` then the image will be referenced as:

```
/src/img/woof.jpg
```

...which then resolves to the current host:

```
http://myhost.test/src/img/woof.jpg
```

...when what you really want is for it to be coming from the Vite dev server:

```
http://localhost:3000/src/img/woof.jpg
```

This is only a problem when you’re using Vite with a backend system like Craft CMS, where the host you run the site from
is different from where the Vite dev server runs.

To work around this, as of Vite ^2.6.0 you can use the server.origin config to tell Vite to serve the static assets it
builds from the Vite dev server, and not the site server:

```js
server: {
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
  host: '0.0.0.0',
}
```

This issue was [discussed in detail](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/4337#issuecomment-885710791),
and [fixed via a pull request](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/5104) that was rolled into Vite `^2.6.0` in the form
of the `origin` setting.

### Other Config

Vite uses [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) so it is very fast, and has built-in support for TypeScript and
JSX.

Vite also comes with support for a number of [plugins](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/) that allow you to use:

* **[Vue.js 3.x](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue)**
* **[Vue.js 2.x](https://github.com/underfin/vite-plugin-vue2)**
* **[React fast refresh](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react-refresh)**

You can easily use [Tailwind CSS with Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vue-3-vite) as well, with or without the
JIT.

Check out [Awesome Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite) for other great Vite plugins & resources.

## Using Vite

### The `.script()` function

The `script()` function is the primary tag you will use with Vite. It outputs the JavaScript and CSS tags generated by
for your input JavaScript files.

#### JavaScript

Once the Vite plugin is installed and configured, using it is quite simple. Where you would normally link to a
JavaScript file via Twig in a `<script>` tag, you instead do:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.script("src/js/app.ts") }}
```

Note that Vite automatically also supports the direct linking to TypeScript (as in the above example), JSX, and other
files via plugins. You just link directly to them, that’s it.

##### Development

If the Vite dev server is running, this will cause it to output something like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/src/js/app.ts"></script>
```

This is causing it to get the script file from the Vite dev server, with full hot module replacement (HMR) support.

##### Production

In production or otherwise where the Vite dev server is not running, the output will look something like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://example.com/dist/assets/app.56c9ea9d.js" crossorigin></script>
<link href="https://example.com/dist/assets/app.c30f6458.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
```

##### Module Preload tags

The Vite plugin will also generate `<link rel="modulepreload">` tags for any script modules that your script output
via `craft.vite.script()` imports. The tags will look like this:

```html
<link href="http://localhost:8000//dist/assets/vendor.a785de16.js" rel="modulepreload" crossorigin>
```

Preloading [helps with performance](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/modulepreload) by telling the
browser about what it needs to fetch so that it’s not stuck with nothing to do during those long roundtrips.

##### Sub-Resource Integrity

If you use a Vite plugin such as [vite-plugin-manifest-sri](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-manifest-sri), the
Craft Vite plugin will
include [subresource integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) attributes
for the `<script type="module">` & `<link rel="modulepreload">` tags that it generates as well. For example:

```html
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/src/js/app.ts"
        integrity="oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC"></script>
```

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch are
delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched
resource must match.

**N.B.:** If you use a service such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) with **Auto Minify** enabled, this alters the payload that is being delivered dynamically, which will cause the SRI check to fail, and your files will not load.

The same is true for any modifications to the built JavaScript. External changes to the built files is exactly what SRI is designed to thwart. So you will need to either disable any options that dynamically alter your built files, or don't use SRI.

##### Script `onload` events

The `<script>` tags generated by Vite will automatically fire a `vite-script-loaded` event dispatched to `document` so
listeners can be notified after a script loads.

If you have JavaScript that needs to be executed after one of your scripts are loaded, you can listen for this event:

```js
document.addEventListener('vite-script-loaded', function (e) {
  if (e.detail.path === 'src/js/app.ts') {
    // The script with the path src/js/app.ts is now loaded, do whatever initialization is needed
  }
});
```

#### CSS

To use [CSS with Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css), you _must_ import it in one of your `build.input`
JavaScript file entries listed in the `vite.config.js`, for example:

```js
import '/src/css/app.pcss';
```

The Vite plugin will take care of automatically generating the `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag for you in production.

By default, it loads the [CSS asynchronously](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/), but you can
configure this. See the **Other Options** section.

#### Polyfills

To work properly, you must also import the [Vite Polyfill](https://vitejs.dev/config/#build-polyfilldynamicimport) in
your `build.input` JavaScript file entries listed in the `vite.config.js`, for example:

```js
import "vite/dynamic-import-polyfill";
```

#### Legacy

If you’re using the `vite-plugin-legacy` plugin to generate builds compatible with older browsers, the Vite plugin will
automatically detect this and use
the [module/nomodule](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) pattern when
outputting production build tags.

The Twig code:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.script("src/js/app.ts") }}
```

Would then result in the following output, depending on whether the Vite dev server is running:

##### Development

If the Vite dev server is running, this will cause it to output something like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/src/js/app.ts"></script>
```

This is causing it to get the script file from the Vite dev server, with full hot module replacement (HMR) support.

##### Production

In production or otherwise where the Vite dev server is not running, the output will look something like this:

```html
<script>
    !function () {
        var e = document, t = e.createElement("script");
        if (!("noModule" in t) && "onbeforeload" in t) {
            var n = !1;
            e.addEventListener("beforeload", function (e) {
                if (e.target === t) n = !0; else if (!e.target.hasAttribute("nomodule") || !n) return;
                e.preventDefault()
            }, !0), t.type = "module", t.src = ".", e.head.appendChild(t), t.remove()
        }
    }();
</script>
<script type="nomodule" src="https://example.com/dist/assets/polyfills-legacy.8fce4e35.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="https://example.com/dist/assets/app.56c9ea9d.js" crossorigin></script>
<link href="https://example.com/dist/assets/app.c30f6458.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
<script type="nomodule" src="https://example.com/dist/assets/app-legacy.0c84e934.js"></script>
```

So that includes:

- Safari 10.1 [nomodule fix script](https://gist.github.com/samthor/64b114e4a4f539915a95b91ffd340acc)
- Legacy `nomodule` polyfills for dynamic imports for older browsers
- Modern `app.js` module for modern browsers
- Extracted CSS
- Legacy `app.js` script for legacy browsers

### The `.register()` function

In addition to the `craft.vite.script()` function, the Vite plugin also provides a `.register()` function:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.register("src/js/app.ts") }}
```

This works exactly the way the `.script()` function works, but instead of outputting the tags, it _registers_ them with
the `Craft::$app->getView()`.

This is primarily useful in plugins that must exist inside of the CP, or other things that leverage the Yii2
AssetBundles and dependencies.

### The `.entry()` function

The Vite plugin includes an `.entry()` function that retrieves the URL to the entry in the `manifest.json` file. This
function will **not** ever return a URL from the devServer.

You pass in a relative path to the entry, just as you do for JavaScript files in Vite. For example:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.entry("app.css") }}
```

This will return a URL like this in regardless of whether the devServer is running or not:

```
http://localhost:8000/dist/assets/app.66b94608.css
```

### The `.asset()` function

The Vite plugin includes a `.asset()` function that retrieves an asset served via Vite in your templates. Assets served
from Vite include images or fonts that are referenced via CSS, or are imported via JavaScript.

You pass in a relative path to the asset, just as you do for JavaScript files in Vite. For example:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.asset("src/images/quote-open.svg") }}
```

This will return a URL like this when the Vite dev server is running:

```
http://localhost:3000/src/assets/img/quote-open.svg
```

...and a URL like this in production when the Vite dev server is not running:

```
http://localhost:8000/dist/assets/quote-open.66b94608.svg
```

**N.B.:** this is only for assets referenced via CSS or imported via JavaScript. For other static assets, you can either
put them in the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) or you can use
the [rollup-plugin-copy](https://github.com/vladshcherbin/rollup-plugin-copy) to copy the assets into your
public `dist/` directory:

```javascript
import copy from 'rollup-plugin-copy';

export default ({command}) => ({
  plugins: [
    copy({
      targets: [{src: 'src/fonts/**/*', dest: '../cms/web/dist/fonts'}],
      hook: 'writeBundle'
    }),
  ]
});
```

If you need to access assets that are in the `public/` directory from Twig, there is a second parameter you can pass to `craft.vite.asset` to inidicate that the asset is coming from the `public/` directory:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.asset("src/images/quote-open.svg", true) }}
```

#### Using `craft.vite.asset` with CSS

If you are using Vite 3.x or later, you can also use `craft.vite.asset` to manually include CSS that is a top-level entry in your `vite.config.js` (rather than being imported into your JavaScript):

```twig
{{ craft.vite.asset("src/css/app.css") }}
```

This assumes your `vite.config.js` looks something like this:

```js
build: {
  emptyOutDir: true,
  manifest: true,
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      app: 'src/js/app.ts',
      css: 'src/css/app.css'
    },
    output: {
      sourcemap: true
    },
  }
},
```

### The `.inline()` function

The Vite plugin also includes a `.inline()` function that inlines the contents of a local file (via path) or remote
file (via URL) in your templates.

Yii2 aliases and/or environment variables may be used, and a caching layer is used so that remote files will be kept in
the cache until it is cleared, for performance reasons.

URL example:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.inline("https://example.com/my-file.txt") }}
```

Path example:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.inline("@webroot/my-file.txt") }}
```

### The `.devServerRunning()` function

The Vite plugin has a `.devServerRunning()` function that allows you to determine if the Vite dev server is running from
your Twig templates.

For instance, you could do:

```twig
{% if craft.vite.devServerRunning() %}
  <base href="{{ alias('@viteBaseUrl') }}">
{% endif %}
```

To side-step
the [Vite Processed Assets](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-vite-js-next-generation-frontend-tooling-with-craft-cms#vite-processed-assets)
issue.

### The `.includeCriticalCssTags()` function

The Vite plugin includes a `.includeCriticalCssTags()` function that will look for a file in `criticalPath` that matches
the name of the currently rendering template, with `criticalSuffix` appended to it.

Used in combination with the [rollup-plugin-critical](https://github.com/nystudio107/rollup-plugin-critical) plugin,
this automates the inclusion of critical CSS. For example:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.includeCriticalCssTags() }}
```

To pass in your own path to a specific critical CSS file, specify the template path you used to generate that file 
(see `criticalPages` in the `vite.config.js` in the [rollup-plugin-critical](https://github.com/nystudio107/rollup-plugin-critical). 

```twig
{{ craft.vite.includeCriticalCssTags("homepage/index") }}
```

...and you can also pass in attributes to be added to the `<style>` tag as well:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.includeCriticalCssTags(null, {
  'data-css-info': 'bar',
}) }}
```

If `null` is passed in as the first parameter, it’ll use the automatic template matching to determine the filename.

### The `.getCssHash()` function

Pass in the path to your entrypoint script, and it will return the hash of the CSS asset:

```twig
{% set cssHash = craft.vite.getCssHash("src/js/app.ts") %}
```

If the CSS file in the manifest has the name `app.245485b3.css`, the above function will return `245485b3`.

This can be used for critical CSS patterns, for example:

```twig
{# -- Critical CSS -- #}
{#
 # Use Nginx Server Sider Includes (SSI) to render different HTML depending on
 # the value in the `critical-css` cookie. ref: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssi_module.html
 #}
{% set cssHash = craft.vite.getCssHash("src/js/app.ts") %}
{#
 # If the `critical-css` cookie is set, the client already has the CSS file download,
 # so don't include the critical CSS, and load the full stylesheet(s) synchronously
 #}
<!--# if expr="$HTTP_COOKIE=/critical\-css\={{ cssHash }}/" -->
{{ craft.vite.script("src/js/app.ts", false) }}
<!--# else -->
{#
 # If the cookie is not set, set the cookie, then include the critical CSS for this page,
 # and load the full stylesheet(s) asychronously
 #}
<script>
  Cookie.set("critical-css", "{{ cssHash }}", { expires: "7D", secure: true });
</script>
{{ craft.vite.includeCriticalCssTags() }}
{{ craft.vite.script("src/js/app.ts", true) }}
<!--# endif -->
```

### Other Options

The `.script()` and `.register()` functions accept additional options as well:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.script(PATH, ASYNC_CSS, SCRIPT_TAG_ATTRS, CSS_TAG_ATTRS) }}
```

* **`PATH`** - `string` - the path to the script
* **`ASYNC_CSS`** - `boolean` - whether any CSS should be loaded async or not (defaults to `true`)
* **`SCRIPT_TAG_ATTRS`** - `array` - an array of key-value pairs for additional attributes to add to any generated
  script tags
* **`CSS_TAG_ATTRS`** - `array` - an array of key-value pairs for additional attributes to add to any generated CSS link
  tags

So for example:

```twig
{{ craft.vite.script(
  "src/js/app.ts",
  false,
  { 'data-script-info': 'foo' },
  { 'data-css-info': 'bar' },
) }}
```
